This is Shuowen Wei's project 1

All of these four Matlab scripts support grayscale and color .bmp images, as well as .jpg images.

After the prompt of the Matlab window, type the name of the script and press "Enter" to run the program, for example: 

	>> ecbImageEnc

Make sure all your inputs are correct and in right format, and target files should exit under the same folder with the scripts, or it will return an error. It is recommended to clear the memeory
before running the programs, though not required.

The original images will show up first and it will pause for 2 seconds  before the encrypted or decrypted images show up. 

All the encrypted or decrypted images are saved to the current working folder.
