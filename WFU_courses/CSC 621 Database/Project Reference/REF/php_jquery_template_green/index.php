<p>This template uses HTML and PHP to generate the page properties dynamically according to the properties you set at the top of each page. jQuery version 1.6.2 has already been implemented and is ready to use. All jQuery script can be placed in the external file in the "js" folder called "custom_js.js". Feel free to change whatever is necessary for your site.</p>
